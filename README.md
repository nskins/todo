# Todo ![CI](https://github.com/nskins/todo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A multi-user to-do app focused on usability.

## Getting Started

Here's how to run Todo on `localhost`:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Database

Todo utilizes PostgreSQL for persistent storage. Here's a [really great tutorial](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial.html) for newbies.
